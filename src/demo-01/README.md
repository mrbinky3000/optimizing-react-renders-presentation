## Passing a Prop Down To a Sub-Component 

We are passing the username from the page level down through all the A blocks and all the B blocks.

The difference between the A and B blocks is that the A blocks are optimized using React.memo() and the B blocks have no optimizations

Clicking on Username updates the username to new name.

Clicking on Timestamp updates that block's timestamp.
