## Passing a prop to a Sub-Component Using Recoil

This demo uses Recoil. Recoil was created by Facebook. It feels like Redux, but with less boilerplate and is designed to be compatible with new React features like Concurrent Mode.

Honestly, we should prob move from redux to this, although recent updates to redux tool kit still make redux a viable choice.
