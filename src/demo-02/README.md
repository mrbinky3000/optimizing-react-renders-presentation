# Demo 2
## Passing a prop to a Sub-Component Using Context

This demo does not pass the username down through each component.  It uses the React context.api instead.  

The context is defined at the "Page" block level.  

The last block in the A blocks subscribes to the context.  

The B blocks still pass the username down through all the blocks.
